"nWYoY","For many in education, and as someone who's currently sitting his A2 exams, the reason many disliked him for his actions were due to, as I see it, 3 main reasons:

Firstly, his desire to get rid of coursework in all subjects has rendered subjects such as English, Languages, RE, etc. to now be completely exam based. Many teachers have gone against this by saying that making these subjects fully exam based has taken away from the indepth analysis that coursework can offer. Only to be replaced by students learning soundbites by rote that they can rewrite in the exam. 

Secondly, his alterations to GCSE's, and now A-levels have made it harder for the teachers to cover the entire course in a years time. I'll use A-levels as an example as it's fresher in my mind, but now students are required to sit their 'AS' exams, to get a rough estimation for their grade next year, and then resit these exams along with their new A2 exams all at the end of year 13. This means students learn a syllabus for a test they won't take for over a year. (As the first sitting of the AS exam doesn't count towards their grade). Therefore, teachers are struggling how to construct their syllabus to be able to accommodate for this large amount of info needed, whilst also keeping the students minds fresh on something they taught the students a year ago.

Thirdly, his pressing for Academies has been demonised by students, teachers, unions, universities, and more. By giving all schools independence from councils you are forcing some schools to take independence despite the fact they were working correctly under the current system. We've seen Academies do good for some schools, and bad for others. To use anecdotal evidence, my own school became an Academy 4 years ago now (I believe, I'd have to check) and because of a lack of effective budgeting within the school, there is a constant lack of investment in subjects such as Tech, languages, now also History, Music, and Drama meanwhile the Maths department recently received a new block worth £1.25 million. 

Overall, his changes to education seem to be encompassed with giving schools independence for ideological reasons and forcing subjects to be fully exam based to alleviate any drops in quality that could occur by making academies. With just exams, teachers can quite easily teach kids exactly what to write instead of how to write and how to learn for University.

Sorry for wall of text, but I genuinely do not like what Gove did to Education in this country, although I do understand it wasn't his 100% fault.

Still better than Nicky Morgan though amirite.","for many in education , and as someone who 's currently sitting his a2 exams , the reason many disliked him for his actions were due to , as i see it , 3 main reasons : firstly , his desire to get rid of coursework in all subjects has rendered subjects such as english , languages , re , etc . to now be completely exam based . many teachers have gone against this by saying that making these subjects fully exam based has taken away from the indepth analysis that coursework can offer . only to be replaced by students learning soundbites by rote that they can rewrite in the exam . secondly , his alterations to gcse 's , and now a-levels have made it harder for the teachers to cover the entire course in a years time . i 'll use a-levels as an example as it 's fresher in my mind , but now students are required to sit their 'as ' exams , to get a rough estimation for their grade next year , and then resit these exams along with their new a2 exams all at the end of year 13. this means students learn a syllabus for a test they wo n't take for over a year .

"k8f05","To admit a new member state to the EU, the Commission needs to assess whether the proposed new member meets the many tough criteria for EU membership and make a recommendation to the existing members on it. This involves assessing them against the 35 chapters of the acquis communautaire.

Turkey opened negotiations 11 years ago and in that time has managed to close 1 out of the 35 chapters. They haven't even opened formal discussions on the majority of them. And Turkey has been backsliding badly under Erdogan in recent years, meaning the rate of progress looks set to slow not accelerate.

At the current rate of progress of one chapter in 11 years though, it would mean Turkey would be ready for membership in about the year 2390 (for reference, that's about 11 years after the events of Star Trek: Nemesis).

Once Turkey reaches that point, *every* existing member of the club needs to agree to the proposal to admit this new member. There are 28 members currently who would all need to agree to this. If 27 vote yes and one votes no, because that one member thinks Turkey only meets 34 out of the 35 chapters,  then the no vote wins. I think this is a horribly impractical system, but it's the level of control that the member states have agreed to when accepting new members into their club.

In the long term, I think Turkey's future is in Europe and it would benefit both sides enormously. But I don't think it's a realistic or desirable outcome any time soon.

"oIlaZ","It wasn't used wildly out of context. It was an accurate quote but he felt people might believe he had a less nuanced view about leaving the EU than he actually held. From [his blog post about it](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-nissan-to-take-legal-action-against-vote-leave-campaign-over-leaflet-a7091556.html):

&gt;A couple of weeks ago I was so stunned I dropped my wallet (you can imagine how tightly I cling to that) when a Stronger In Europe leaflet popped through my door with my face and quote at the top. I hadn’t been asked for permission, nor am I campaigning for either side (see the truth about the leaflet blog).

&gt;The quote was accurate. It came from ITV’s The Agenda where I was put on the spot with a direct question. I’m not a politician, so I answered, saying: “On balance of probability, it is more likely we’ll have less money in our pockets if we vote to leave”.

&gt;On its own, especially as I cautioned it was a finely-balanced probability call, it isn’t a glowing endorsement. However, in the context of the leaflet it seems more.

&gt;Indeed ever since a November poll petrifyingly said I’m the UK’s most-trusted person on the EU vote, even some of my minor utterances have been picked up. Including when asked directly how I was likely to vote.

&gt;**My concern is, having tried to present arguments from both sides, I don’t want anyone to read this and feel later I’d hidden something that is out there.**

&gt;**I’m generally risk-averse, and that pushes me just towards an IN vote for safety**, maybe 55% to 45%. Yet just as my dream holiday isn’t necessarily yours, no more is my choice of what’s right a call for you to follow me. Far better is follow the logic above.

He also said in another blog post about it:
&gt;My frustration is the impression this gives that I am backing the ‘in’ campaign. It doesn’t say that overtly, but certainly by the mass of tweets (and some abuse) I’ve received, many people read it as meaning that.

&gt;However, as a journalist, I have taken quotes people have said on television and used them, without their permission – **it’s standard form, so while it’s frustrating, it’s par for the course**.

[Ironically, Guido then actually misquoted him to imply the remain campaign has misquoted him](http://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2016/05/20/quote-misquotes-and-the-truth-about-my-appearance-in-the-stronger-in-europe-leaflet/?_ga=1.245252807.374696860.1451042030).","it was n't used wildly out of context . it was an accurate quote but he felt people might believe he had a less nuanced view about leaving the eu than he actually held . from [ his blog post about it ] ( URL ) : > a couple of weeks ago i was so stunned i dropped my wallet ( you can imagine how tightly i cling to that ) when a stronger in europe leaflet popped through my door with my face and quote at the top . i hadn ’ t been asked for permission , nor am i campaigning for either side ( see the truth about the leaflet blog ) . > the quote was accurate . it came from itv ’ s the agenda where i was put on the spot with a direct question . i ’ m not a politician , so i answered , saying : “ on balance of probability , it is more likely we ’ ll have less money in our pockets if we vote to leave ” . > on its own , especially as i cautioned it was a finely-balanced probability call , it isn ’ t a glowing endorsement . however , in the context of the leaflet it seems more . > indeed ever since a november poll petrifyingly said i ’ m the uk ’ s most-trusted person on the eu vote , even some of my minor utterances have been picked up . including when asked directly how i was likely to vote . > **my concern is , having tried to present arguments from both sides , i don ’ t want anyone to read this and feel later i ’ d hidden something that is out there . ** > **i ’ m generally risk-averse , and that pushes me just towards an in vote for safety** , maybe 55 % to 45 % . yet just as my dream holiday isn ’ t necessarily yours , no more is my choice of what ’ s right a call for you to follow me . far better is follow the logic above . he also said in another blog post about it : > my frustration is the impression this gives that i am backing the ‘ in ’ campaign . it doesn ’ t say that overtly , but certainly by the mass of tweets ( and some abuse ) i ’ ve received , many people read it as meaning that . > however , as a journalist , i have taken quotes people have said on television and used them , without their permission – **it ’ s standard form , so while it ’ s frustrating , it ’ s par for the course** .

"NhfuA","Just a point on this. Renationalisation wasn't an issue until very recently. Under the 3rd Railways Directive it was perfectly feasible. However the EU introduced the [4th Railways Directive](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-1383_en.htm) earlier this year which as far as I understand it forces governments to open up PSO contracts to 3rd parties. We can of course still have public sector railway operators but they couldn't be given monopoly status. 

Just pointing this out because it came up last year and at that time people were right that renationalisation would be feasible, but not any more is my understanding.

"FdrUD","This demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt everything that Remain supporters have been saying for months.

- **The EU has been good for Britain**. The UK used to be the sick man of Europe. Its annual growth in prosperity has improved from bottom of the league among the G7 leading economies before it joined the European Economic Community to top spot in the 43 years after 1973. 

- **What trade deals would replace EU membership?** Negotiate deals with 77 countries to match what we have today. Leaving the EU would require a mammoth negotiation process, since Britain could not even guarantee to be able to trade securely under WTO rules. 

- **Could Britain cut migration significantly?** Migrants contribute more to the UK public finances than they take out and much more than UK born citizens. And their numbers appear to be plateauing. Because we need them, no responsible government will actually try to reduce migration, which is why current points based non-EU migration is still high. 

- **Do migrants reduce UK wages?** There is no correlation between the change in the share of EU immigrants for every local area in the UK and the change in local wage levels indicating that areas with high levels of immigration do not have lower wage growth. There is no indication that immigration reduces wages, even for the low paid. 

- **Are EU regulations a yoke around the neck of the UK economy?** This is a massive Leave myth. The OECD assesses that the UK has the second lowest level of product market regulation among its members, just below the Netherlands.

- **What about the £350m a week sent to Brussels?** This figure is not correct. And there is no doubt that the effect of EU membership on national income is more important for the UK public finances than the annual membership fee - a small hit would leave Britain’s public sector worse off.

**Economists overwhelmingly think leaving the EU is bad for the UK economy. Rarely has there been such a consensus among economists, as there is on the damage that Brexit would wreak on the British economy.**","this demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt everything that remain supporters have been saying for months . - **the eu has been good for britain** . the uk used to be the sick man of europe . its annual growth in prosperity has improved from bottom of the league among the g7 leading economies before it joined the european economic community to top spot in the 43 years after 1973 . - **what trade deals would replace eu membership ? ** negotiate deals with 77 countries to match what we have today . leaving the eu would require a mammoth negotiation process , since britain could not even guarantee to be able to trade securely under wto rules . - **could britain cut migration significantly ? ** migrants contribute more to the uk public finances than they take out and much more than uk born citizens . and their numbers appear to be plateauing . because we need them , no responsible government will actually try to reduce migration , which is why current points based non-eu migration is still high . - **do migrants reduce uk wages ? ** there is no correlation between the change in the share of eu immigrants for every local area in the uk and the change in local wage levels indicating that areas with high levels of immigration do not have lower wage growth . there is no indication that immigration reduces wages , even for the low paid . - **are eu regulations a yoke around the neck of the uk economy ? ** this is a massive leave myth . the oecd assesses that the uk has the second lowest level of product market regulation among its members , just below the netherlands . - **what about the £350m a week sent to brussels ? ** this figure is not correct . and there is no doubt that the effect of eu membership on national income is more important for the uk public finances than the annual membership fee - a small hit would leave britain ’ s public sector worse off . **economists overwhelmingly think leaving the eu is bad for the uk economy . rarely has there been such a consensus among economists , as there is on the damage that brexit would wreak on the british economy . **",1466585229,"ukpolitics",55,"t3_4p99ws","t3_4p99ws",2016-06-22 08:47:09,NA,NA

"vW4yO","&gt; To suggest that we can’t survive outside the EU is ridiculous

No one is suggesting this my friend. We are simply suggesting that time has proved to us that countries that can trade freely with others without taxes imposed on the movement of said goods perform better.

&gt; and to suggest that we will struggle to form trade agreements once outside the EU is just plain bizarre – in what world would the fifth biggest economy struggle to form trade agreements with other countries?

Of course you could, but free trade agreements aren't ever half as good as Single Markets. Remember Single Market does not equal FTA. There is a difference, FTA do not allow for services to be used freely from country to country, while Single Markets do. And when 80% of your economy is services then you will actually have an absolutely huge problem. We need that single market, not FTA.

&gt; Do we really want to be part of a Union that outright threatens us if we democratically vote to leave?

This is normal behavior. The UK said lots of threatening things to Scotland before their vote too.

&gt; Currently, every individual in the EU has the right to come and live in the UK - so the EU has a policy of uncontrolled immigration. This week Jeremy Corbyn announced controlled immigration is impossible if we stay in the EU – which means a vote for Remain is a vote for continued uncontrolled immigration. This alone is enough of a reason to justify Brexit. It’s become obvious that Britain simply cannot sustain uncontrolled immigration. Remainers say Britain can’t survive outside of the EU – but the reality is Britain can’t survive within the EU - the strain put on public services by 330,000 EU migrants a year is absolutely unsustainable.

The articles you are linking are baseless opinions from different people. For every article you link saying that we can't cope with immigration I could link another saying we can, even that they improve the economy.

I could go on.
And also

&gt; This week Jeremy Corbyn announced controlled immigration is impossible if we stay in the EU

While I agree that immigration cannot be **directly** controlled I do believe that it will be **indirectly** controlled for many reasons. Two of my main reasons are:

* I believe David Cameron's deal with the EU is vastly underestimated. He has managed to achieve a block for migrants claiming benefits until they have lived and worked for 4 years. This makes the UK a much less attractive destination for EU migrants, they will be much more attracted to places like Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium where no such controls are in place.

* The economies of the majority of migrants are coming from such as Romania and Bulgaria are growing at an insane pace and has foretasted to grow at around 5%. If this pace keeps up then Romania will become attractive in a decade.

&gt; Turkey. Oh, Turkey. Remainers love to pretend that Turkey has no prospect of joining the EU. Maybe they’re right – the point is we don’t know, and we can’t know.

Actually, we do know. There are only two countries that want Turkey in the EU, that is Germany and the UK. 2/28. There is no way in hell it will happen. How could Greece possibly ever accept that, they would never? It is much more likely if we left Cameron would impose a free movement agreement with Turkey than the EU, making leave more likely for TUrks to come here.

&gt; This is a simple one – if we want the UK to be a sovereign country, we have to vote leave. If we want to be part of a true democracy, we have to vote leave. The EU is absolutely, fundamentally undemocratic. Being 1 of 28 countries in the EU, we have absolutely no say in electing 27 out of any 28 elected officials who are deciding how to run our country.

This argument always makes me LOL. I'll give you an example, I live in Northern Ireland. There are 650 MPs in the UK. Northern Ireland has 18 MPs. Could I use your basis of argument to also call the UK undemocratic since I can not elect 632 MPs? No, because that is the whole point of a union.

&gt; When we decide we don’t like the current UK government, we vote them out and get in a new one - if we decide we don’t like the EU parliament however, there’s nothing we can do after tomorrow.

You could elect your MEPs? And your commissioner will be appointed by a government you elect, just like the rest of the UK cabinet.

&gt; We’re done having laws imposed on us by unelected bureaucrats, and we’re done acting as the EUs personal slush-fund.

The whole UK cabinet is unelected and appointed by the PM, do you want to leave Westminster too? If not, why not?

&gt; We need to believe in Britain, we need to believe in the facts, and we need to believe we are a strong enough and great enough country to prosper outside of the EU, as we did for hundreds and hundreds of years before it suckered us in.

I believe that countries are stronger when they come together in a political union. I am not a ""little Englander"" who thinks Britain is greater than every other country, I think we are just your average OECD country and I think we require other countries for extra growth, this is not an opinion but a well known fact.","> to suggest that we can ’ t survive outside the eu is ridiculous no one is suggesting this my friend . we are simply suggesting that time has proved to us that countries that can trade freely with others without taxes imposed on the movement of said goods perform better . > and to suggest that we will struggle to form trade agreements once outside the eu is just plain bizarre – in what world would the fifth biggest economy struggle to form trade agreements with other countries ? of course you could , but free trade agreements are n't ever half as good as single markets . remember single market does not equal fta . there is a difference , fta do not allow for services to be used freely from country to country , while single markets do . and when 80 % of your economy is services then you will actually have an absolutely huge problem . we need that single market , not fta . > do we really want to be part of a union that outright threatens us if we democratically vote to leave ? this is normal behavior . the uk said lots of threatening things to scotland before their vote too . > currently , every individual in the eu has the right to come and live in the uk - so the eu has a policy of uncontrolled immigration . this week jeremy corbyn announced controlled immigration is impossible if we stay in the eu – which means a vote for remain is a vote for continued uncontrolled immigration . this alone is enough of a reason to justify brexit . it ’ s become obvious that britain simply can not sustain uncontrolled immigration . remainers say britain can ’ t survive outside of the eu – but the reality is britain can ’ t survive within the eu - the strain put on public services by 330,000 eu migrants a year is absolutely unsustainable . the articles you are linking are baseless opinions from different people . for every article you link saying that we ca n't cope with immigration i could link another saying we can , even that they improve the economy . URL URL URL i could go on . and also > this week jeremy corbyn announced controlled immigration is impossible if we stay in the eu while i agree that immigration can not be **directly** controlled i do believe that it will be **indirectly** controlled for many reasons . two of my main reasons are : * i believe david cameron 's deal with the eu is vastly underestimated . he has managed to achieve a block for migrants claiming benefits until they have lived and worked for 4 years . this makes the uk a much less attractive destination for eu migrants , they will be much more attracted to places like germany , france , netherlands , belgium where no such controls are in place . * the economies of the majority of migrants are coming from such as romania and bulgaria are growing at an insane pace and has foretasted to grow at around 5 % . if this pace keeps up then romania will become attractive in a decade . > turkey . oh , turkey . remainers love to pretend that turkey has no prospect of joining the eu . maybe they ’ re right – the point is we don ’ t know , and we can ’ t know . actually , we do know . there are only two countries that want turkey in the eu , that is germany and the uk . 2/28 . there is no way in hell it will happen . how could greece possibly ever accept that , they would never ? it is much more likely if we left cameron would impose a free movement agreement with turkey than the eu , making leave more likely for turks to come here . > this is a simple one – if we want the uk to be a sovereign country , we have to vote leave . if we want to be part of a true democracy , we have to vote leave . the eu is absolutely , fundamentally undemocratic . being 1 of 28 countries in the eu , we have absolutely no say in electing 27 out of any 28 elected officials who are deciding how to run our country . this argument always makes me lol . i 'll give you an example , i live in northern ireland . there are 650 mps in the uk . northern ireland has 18 mps . could i use your basis of argument to also call the uk undemocratic since i can not elect 632 mps ? no , because that is the whole point of a union . > when we decide we don ’ t like the current uk government , we vote them out and get in a new one - if we decide we don ’ t like the eu parliament however , there ’ s nothing we can do after tomorrow . you could elect your meps ? and your commissioner will be appointed by a government you elect , just like the rest of the uk cabinet . > we ’ re done having laws imposed on us by unelected bureaucrats , and we ’ re done acting as the eus personal slush-fund . the whole uk cabinet is unelected and appointed by the pm , do you want to leave westminster too ? if not , why not ? > we need to believe in britain , we need to believe in the facts , and we need to believe we are a strong enough and great enough country to prosper outside of the eu , as we did for hundreds and hundreds of years before it suckered us in . i believe that countries are stronger when they come together in a political union . i am not a `` little englander '' who thinks britain is greater than every other country , i think we are just your average oecd country and i think we require other countries for extra growth , this is not an opinion but a well known fact .",1466622146,"ukpolitics",46,"t3_4pbz2t","t3_4pbz2t",2016-06-22 19:02:26,NA,NA

"8OmFi","HK law student here, I wanted to give you guys a bit of history and attitudes towards the British in HK. Keep in mind I was 4 years old when HK was handed over, and so I never really experienced British colonial rule personally.

* For a majority of the 100ish year rule Britain had over HK, HK served as a colonial vessel for British trade to China. That was all HK was to the British; a port to trade with China. HK was given to Britain in the late 1800s.
* British rule was more or less seen as pretty oppressive and to my understanding HK people resented their white overlords. There were race based laws, and preferential treatment because you were white.
* The 'good ol' days' of British colonial rule largely comes from Governor Maclehose in the 1970s who introduced public housing, compulsory primary and secondary school education, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), lots of social welfare programs and the introduction of Chinese as an official language. These policies as you might imagine won the hearts of local HK people, and helped drive the city forward into the modern world, far ahead of China and even Beijing.
* Go back to post WWII, and Britain at this point had already began the process of de-colonisation. But it hesitated to give HK back to a politically unstable post war China because of the civil war between the communists and the democrats, where the communists eventually ruled China and the democrats turned to Taiwan. However China since the 80s was beginning to see massive improvements in its infrastructure and economy under Deng Xiaoping. By then, it was already set in stone that HK was to return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. (When the New Territories lease to Britain of 100 years was to expire, Britain would return NT, Kowloon and HK Island to China) 
* There was tons of tension as to how HK was to return to China given the fact that nobody knew for certain how HK was to operate politically and legally (since HK still by and large use British Common law). China had concerns as to how democratic Britain was making Hong Kong, giving locals more political power through its progressive reforms. There are arguments that this was aimed to keep indirect British rule in HK through the political and legal process under the guise of human rights.
* The result of years of negotiations between Britain and China ended up with China agreeing to use it's 1 country 2 systems law giving HK 50 years of political and legal independence. (applies to Macau too, from the Portuguese) 1 country 2 systems was originally drafted for Taiwan. It's designed to integrate a different political system into China's own, the ultimate goal being that in the end it will all be part of China politically and legally.
* of course, 1C2S is a bit of a paradox since how can you have true political and legal independence if you're still subject to the Chinese sovereignty. It was, in my view more or less an agreement from China to take a very hands off approach to governing.
* China has since and still keeps a very hands off approach to governing HK, but the big constitutional problem was that any reforms in HK's voting system for its Chief Executive, and legislative party, was subject to NPC approval.
* In HK since the handover, lots of people have been calling out for greater democratic representation, which means reforms to voting systems which requires approval by China. There have been reforms, more seats open in the legislative council and more total voters for voting the CE has been given throughout the 2000s. The problem I have with it is that it is still under a facade since CE candidates are subject to screening from China. This was one of the big reasons why the Yellow Umbrella movement happened in 2014. It was to them, a 'final straw' after a HK kept on asking for greater democracy whilst China replies with opening up spaces and voters, but not changing the process itself

IMO, this call to return to British rule is pretty stupid and a very very narrow interpretation of HK's history under British rule. What they really want is true political independence which is frankly impossible.
To be free of Chinese sovereignty is impossible. What HK needs to ask for is better methods of political and legal integration. But that requires HK to accept the fact that it is under Chinese sovereignty. That's hard to foresee when you've got a very vocal political party constantly crying for attention for impossible demands.

edit: added some details and corrected some grammatical errors","hk law student here , i wanted to give you guys a bit of history and attitudes towards the british in hk . keep in mind i was 4 years old when hk was handed over , and so i never really experienced british colonial rule personally . * for a majority of the 100ish year rule britain had over hk , hk served as a colonial vessel for british trade to china . that was all hk was to the british ; a port to trade with china . hk was given to britain in the late 1800s . * british rule was more or less seen as pretty oppressive and to my understanding hk people resented their white overlords . there were race based laws , and preferential treatment because you were white . * the 'good ol ' days ' of british colonial rule largely comes from governor maclehose in the 1970s who introduced public housing , compulsory primary and secondary school education , the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) , lots of social welfare programs and the introduction of chinese as an official language . these policies as you might imagine won the hearts of local hk people , and helped drive the city forward into the modern world , far ahead of china and even beijing . * go back to post wwii , and britain at this point had already began the process of de-colonisation . but it hesitated to give hk back to a politically unstable post war china because of the civil war between the communists and the democrats , where the communists eventually ruled china and the democrats turned to taiwan . however china since the 80s was beginning to see massive improvements in its infrastructure and economy under deng xiaoping . by then , it was already set in stone that hk was to return to chinese sovereignty in 1997 . ( when the new territories lease to britain of 100 years was to expire , britain would return nt , kowloon and hk island to china ) * there was tons of tension as to how hk was to return to china given the fact that nobody knew for certain how hk was to operate politically and legally ( since hk still by and large use british common law ) . china had concerns as to how democratic britain was making hong kong , giving locals more political power through its progressive reforms . there are arguments that this was aimed to keep indirect british rule in hk through the political and legal process under the guise of human rights . * the result of years of negotiations between britain and china ended up with china agreeing to use it 's 1 country 2 systems law giving hk 50 years of political and legal independence . ( applies to macau too , from the portuguese ) 1 country 2 systems was originally drafted for taiwan . it 's designed to integrate a different political system into china 's own , the ultimate goal being that in the end it will all be part of china politically and legally . * of course , 1c2s is a bit of a paradox since how can you have true political and legal independence if you 're still subject to the chinese sovereignty . it was , in my view more or less an agreement from china to take a very hands off approach to governing . * china has since and still keeps a very hands off approach to governing hk , but the big constitutional problem was that any reforms in hk 's voting system for its chief executive , and legislative party , was subject to npc approval . * in hk since the handover , lots of people have been calling out for greater democratic representation , which means reforms to voting systems which requires approval by china . there have been reforms , more seats open in the legislative council and more total voters for voting the ce has been given throughout the 2000s . the problem i have with it is that it is still under a facade since ce candidates are subject to screening from china . this was one of the big reasons why the yellow umbrella movement happened in 2014. it was to them , a 'final straw ' after a hk kept on asking for greater democracy whilst china replies with opening up spaces and voters , but not changing the process itself imo , this call to return to british rule is pretty stupid and a very very narrow interpretation of hk 's history under british rule . what they really want is true political independence which is frankly impossible . to be free of chinese sovereignty is impossible . what hk needs to ask for is better methods of political and legal integration . but that requires hk to accept the fact that it is under chinese sovereignty . that 's hard to foresee when you 've got a very vocal political party constantly crying for attention for impossible demands . edit : added some details and corrected some grammatical errors",1466670315,"ukpolitics",22,"t3_4pdug7","t3_4pdug7",2016-06-23 08:25:15,NA,NA

C. Creating a divide amongst the people of the UK. (this myth that anyone who discusses immigration is called a xenophobe or racist)

As soon as it's over (assuming a remain vote) they'll be wanting to smash ahead with their further economic integration. It's also likely that immigration will continue to accelerate year on year and the migrant crisis is going nowhere in a hurry. 

Cast that in the context of 45% of the population not getting what they want, and deep dissatisfaction with both the conservative and labour parties (and personally with George Osborne/David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn). We may find that leave-voters (predominantly working class White British voters) flock to UKIP at the next general election as a sort of revenge-vote. This isn't historically unheard of, infact we saw it just a year ago after the Scottish referendum where despite losing the SNP went on to a very strong performance at the subsequent general election.

Basically euroskeptisism isn't going anywhere on Friday. The likely result is remain, and that's going to leave 40-45% of the population who have just spent 8 weeks being called racists and xenophobes feeling pretty pissed off.
