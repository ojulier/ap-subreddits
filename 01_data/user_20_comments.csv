"KLy8w","i 've not tried to change the topic at all - all of the comments have been about immigration , and the only mention of race has come from you . i was trying to understand what definition of british could be construed to conclude that british people were a minority in london . of the census data i have seen , the majority of people living in london are british born , british citizens , who identify ( and self-report in the census ) as being british . so when the above poster says 'we ' are a minority , who does he mean ?",1476379159,"ukpolitics",2,"t1_d8qgrjr","t3_579rhw"

"KLy8w","and a few years after we leave the eu , who 's to say it wo n't be 20 million ? those 16.8 million certainly wo n't benefit from there being *fewer* jobs . the attitude of 'things ca n't get any worse ' that drove the protest vote demographic is built on sand . you take a young neet from somewhere in england who failed their gcses and a subsistence farmer in bangladesh and compare the two , and the only real difference you 'll find between them is the economic strength of the country they were born into . things can definitely get worse for those who are struggling - and it 's looking like they probably will . i think a lot of people fail to appreciate exactly how low the floor goes .",1476866707,"ukpolitics",9,"t1_d8yhq3z","t3_5894to"
"KLy8w","you 've failed to address any of this . i 'm not blaming anybody , it 's just the facts of the situation - the only thing separating the economic situation of two people with no material education is the economic situation of their country . what we 're moving away from may well have been a comparative success . there are countries in the world for whom the economic situation of our poorest 25 % would be a drastic improvement . i can absolutely understand why some people voted as a protest over their own economic situation , but that does n't mean there is n't a possibility it was a misjudged vote . i think there are a significant number of people who , having made this protest , will come to look upon their previous economic situation as ' a success ' .",1476868248,"ukpolitics",12,"t1_d8yi8iz","t3_5894to"

"KLy8w","i hate those reddit comments that just say 'this ' , but your comment is word-for-word what i thought when i read this title . i think it must just be based an ideological hatred of the independence of the boe , it 's difficult to criticise the actions of carney individually based on his record . the ousting of carney would be a catastrophic market event in this climate ; it sometimes feels like we 're currently being led by the people from that 'collapse of society ' subreddit .",1477123326,"ukpolitics",4,"t1_d91zlg6","t3_58nyjl"
"KLy8w","you do n't have to look far , they 've all come to clap in this thread too . the article talks about one side of the argument being unbound from reality . with hindsight , maybe cameron should have delayed his renegotiation until after the vote ; he could have just promised an end to free movement , britain 's membership fee being reduced to zero and an eu generally of milk and honey , and when none of it came to pass just do the same , slow , post-match moving of the goalpost we 're seeing now ...",1477823943,"ukpolitics",9,"t3_5a3797","t3_5a3797"
