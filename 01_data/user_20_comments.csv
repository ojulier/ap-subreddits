"KLy8w","I've not tried to change the topic at all - all of the comments have been about immigration, and the only mention of race has come from you. I was trying to understand what definition of British could be construed to conclude that British people were a minority in London. Of the census data I have seen, the majority of people living in London are British born, British citizens, who identify (and self-report in the census) as being British. So when the above poster says 'we' are a minority, who does he mean?

"KLy8w","And a few years after we leave the EU, who's to say it won't be 20 million? Those 16.8 million certainly won't benefit from there being *fewer* jobs.  
  
The attitude of 'things can't get any worse' that drove the protest vote demographic is built on sand. You take a young NEET from somewhere in England who failed their GCSEs and a subsistence farmer in Bangladesh and compare the two, and the only real difference you'll find between them is the economic strength of the country they were born into. Things can definitely get worse for those who are struggling - and it's looking like they probably will. I think a lot of people fail to appreciate exactly how low the floor goes.","and a few years after we leave the eu , who 's to say it wo n't be 20 million ? those 16.8 million certainly wo n't benefit from there being *fewer* jobs . the attitude of 'things ca n't get any worse ' that drove the protest vote demographic is built on sand . you take a young neet from somewhere in england who failed their gcses and a subsistence farmer in bangladesh and compare the two , and the only real difference you 'll find between them is the economic strength of the country they were born into . things can definitely get worse for those who are struggling - and it 's looking like they probably will . i think a lot of people fail to appreciate exactly how low the floor goes .",1476866707,"ukpolitics",9,"t1_d8yhq3z","t3_5894to"
"KLy8w","You've failed to address any of this. I'm not blaming anybody, it's just the facts of the situation - the only thing separating the economic situation of two people with no material education is the economic situation of their country.  
  
What we're moving away from may well have been a comparative success. There are countries in the world for whom the economic situation of our poorest 25% would be a drastic improvement. I can absolutely understand why some people voted as a protest over their own economic situation, but that doesn't mean there isn't a possibility it was a misjudged vote. I think there are a significant number of people who, having made this protest, will come to look upon their previous economic situation as 'a success'.","you 've failed to address any of this . i 'm not blaming anybody , it 's just the facts of the situation - the only thing separating the economic situation of two people with no material education is the economic situation of their country . what we 're moving away from may well have been a comparative success . there are countries in the world for whom the economic situation of our poorest 25 % would be a drastic improvement . i can absolutely understand why some people voted as a protest over their own economic situation , but that does n't mean there is n't a possibility it was a misjudged vote . i think there are a significant number of people who , having made this protest , will come to look upon their previous economic situation as ' a success ' .",1476868248,"ukpolitics",12,"t1_d8yi8iz","t3_5894to"

I think it must just be based an ideological hatred of the independence of the BoE, it's difficult to criticise the actions of Carney individually based on his record.

The article talks about one side of the argument being unbound from reality.
