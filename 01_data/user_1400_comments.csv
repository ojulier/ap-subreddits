"UdXYx","&gt;OK, well how does it differ in the EU, according to you?

In europe libertarianism is a branch of socialism, its leftist. In the US libertarianism is a branch of classical liberalism, its rightist.

&gt;OK. Who has been proven wrong many times over.

Yes, but this was him quoting history, not advancing an argument. ;p

&gt;What's not the case? 

That european libertarianism isn't a branch of left wing thinking. You'll struggle, because it is. Simply, the word ""libertarian"" means something very different in the US than europe, in the same way that ""rubber"" and ""fanny"" have different meanings in Uk english than Yank english.

&gt;The impact of these changes is not just that poor people magically get richer, the impact is that a bunch of people went from having a low paid job to no job at all.

Unless ofc we decide to use subsidies. There are good arguments for this - food security is one. 

&gt;Why do you want poor people to be poorer?

I don't. Why do you want poor people to be poorer?

Theres something interesting in your answers - you assume that because something can be done cheaper, it has to be.

This isn't true. The more you pay people the more the economy grows - its the same reason freeing slaves puts productivity up.

"UdXYx","A major shift in economic policy away from quantitative easing is expected to be announced in this year's Autumn Statement, according to reports. 

Theresa May is said to be backing a break away from the monetary policy pursued by George Osborne and a move towards more fiscal measures, such as tax and spending.

George Freeman, the Conservative MP who chairs the No 10 policy board, confirmed that the change would be announced in next month’s Autumn Statement.

Speaking on Wednesday night to BBC Newsnight, he suggested the policy could be unveiled by the Chancellor Philip Hammond as early as the Autumn Statement.

It comes after Mrs May criticised the ""bad side effects"" of quantitative easing during her speech to the Tory Party conference.



Mr Freeman told Newsnight: ""Philip Hammond is going to set this out in the Autumn Statement, but Theresa has been very clear this model of the emergency QE package, bail out the banks, stabilise the economy, has had a very profound effect on distribution of wealth.

""Those with assets have done very much better than those without. We have to listen to the roar that we heard this year.""

However, neither he nor the sick person matters - what matters is the actions of the healthy who must by the very nature of illness be the ones paying for the sick.

If they follow their market incentive,s they will not help anyone else out and the sick will suffer.

All markets remove all charitable giving to the maximum extent possible and this is no different. Indeed, helping the ill out will only occur to the extent to which those who are well are willing to help voluntarily - which means they aren't obeying market forces.

"UdXYx","&gt;people who are already addicted don't need advertising to, other than to change brands. the most you could say about the advertising ban is that it reduced the amount of people taking up the habit, in conjunction with the tax rises which persuaded a lot of people to quit.

Addictions dont end because you put the price up. That's why the government taxes t, because they know its demand inelastic.

&gt;except they take an oath to do no harm, so they're not going to go around making people ill to drum up business. also there are already plenty, if anything there's a shortage of doctors, not ill people.

So they aren't obeying market forces and that works better than obeying market forces? Decent of you to admit market forces and health don't go together.

&gt;not necessarily. if you're insured, the insurance company pays. if you're part of a prepayment plan, you've already paid. with the exception of taxpayer funded emergency rooms, the patient is the customer.

They are not customers. They do not want to buy. illness is not correlated with ability to pay.

&gt;just wrong. the welfare state and socialised medicine kill off charitable activity, by making it the responsibility of the state to help the needy, absolving people of their duty to others.

The welfare state is mandated charity because markets remove charity completely over time.

&gt;the period in history with the greatest amount of charitable activity was around the late nineteenth and ealry twentieth centuries, when we had almost no welfare state and laissez faire was the order of the day.

Not at all, charity climbed even higher when it started to be mandated by the state.

&gt; all the old hospitals with gorgeous architecture were built then, by philanthropists and free associations of medical practitioners, who as well as providing healthcare for their wealthy patients, provided free healthcare for the poor and in need.

Yes, they didn't follow the market or the price mechanism. 

&gt;people do things that are in their own interest, whether that interest is financial or moral. it's the overreach of the state that neuters people's ability to solve coordination problems for themselves.

Complete pish. 

Heres why.

If you have two people in the market and one is a selfish asshole who just reinvests his money over and over in puruit of profits and nothing else and one who is charitable and giving, the charitable guy will rapidly be outcompeted in the market because he is being outpaced in investment.

The selfish guy winds up with all the resources, and because he's a selfish guy that's the end of charity - this is 100% what happened and why we set up the welfare state and democracies etc.

Pricing does not work in this area for the most part. Motivationally, pain and suffering are way, way higher motivators and credibility and trust are so important as to make price irrelevant.

"UdXYx","The much-hyped severe Brexit recession does not, so far, seem to be materializing – which really shouldn’t be that much of a surprise, because as I warned, the actual economic case for such a recession was surprisingly weak. (Ouch! I just pulled a muscle while patting myself on the back!) But we are seeing a large drop in the pound, which has steepened as it becomes likely that this will indeed be a very hard Brexit. How should we think about this?

Originally, stories about a pound plunge were tied to that recession prediction: domestic investment demand would collapse, leading to sustained very low interest rates, hence capital flight. But the demand collapse doesn’t seem to be happening. So what is the story?

For now, at least, I’m coming at it from the trade side – especially trade in financial services. It seems to me that one way to think about this is in terms of the “home market effect,” an old story in trade but one that only got formalized in 1980. 

Here’s an informal version: imagine a good or service subject to large economies of scale in production, sufficient that if it’s consumed in two countries, you want to produce it in only one, and export to the other, even if there are costs of shipping it. Where will this production be located? Other things equal, you would choose the larger market, so as to minimize total shipping costs. Other things may not, of course, be equal, but this market-size effect will always be a factor, depending on how high those shipping costs are.

In one of the models I laid out in that old paper, the way this worked out was not that all production left the smaller economy, but rather that the smaller economy paid lower wages and therefore made up in competitiveness what it lacked in market access. In effect, it used a weaker currency to make up for its smaller market.

In Britain’s case, I’d suggest that we think of financial services as the industry in question. Such services are subject to both internal and external economies of scale, which tends to concentrate them in a handful of huge financial centers around the world, one of which is, of course, the City of London. But now we face the prospect of seriously increased transaction costs between Britain and the rest of Europe, which creates an incentive to move those services away from the smaller economy (Britain) and into the larger (Europe). Britain therefore needs a weaker currency to offset this adverse impact.

Does this make Britain poorer? Yes. It’s not just the efficiency effect of barriers to trade, there’s also a terms-of-trade effect as the real exchange rate depreciates.

But it’s important to be aware that not everyone in Britain is equally affected. Pre-Brexit, Britain was obviously experiencing a version of the so-called Dutch disease. In its traditional form, this referred to the way natural resource exports crowd out manufacturing by keeping the currency strong. In the UK case, the City’s financial exports play the same role. So their weakening helps British manufacturing – and, maybe, the incomes of people who live far from the City and still depend directly or indirectly on manufacturing for their incomes. It’s not completely incidental that these were the parts of England (not Scotland!) that voted for Brexit.

Is there a policy moral here? Basically it is that a weaker pound shouldn’t be viewed as an additional cost from Brexit, it’s just part of the adjustment. And it would be a big mistake to prop up the pound: old notions of an equilibrium exchange rate no longer apply.","the much-hyped severe brexit recession does not , so far , seem to be materializing – which really shouldn ’ t be that much of a surprise , because as i warned , the actual economic case for such a recession was surprisingly weak . ( ouch ! i just pulled a muscle while patting myself on the back ! ) but we are seeing a large drop in the pound , which has steepened as it becomes likely that this will indeed be a very hard brexit . how should we think about this ? originally , stories about a pound plunge were tied to that recession prediction : domestic investment demand would collapse , leading to sustained very low interest rates , hence capital flight . but the demand collapse doesn ’ t seem to be happening . so what is the story ? for now , at least , i ’ m coming at it from the trade side – especially trade in financial services . it seems to me that one way to think about this is in terms of the “ home market effect , ” an old story in trade but one that only got formalized in 1980. here ’ s an informal version : imagine a good or service subject to large economies of scale in production , sufficient that if it ’ s consumed in two countries , you want to produce it in only one , and export to the other , even if there are costs of shipping it . where will this production be located ? other things equal , you would choose the larger market , so as to minimize total shipping costs . other things may not , of course , be equal , but this market-size effect will always be a factor , depending on how high those shipping costs are . in one of the models i laid out in that old paper , the way this worked out was not that all production left the smaller economy , but rather that the smaller economy paid lower wages and therefore made up in competitiveness what it lacked in market access . in effect , it used a weaker currency to make up for its smaller market . in britain ’ s case , i ’ d suggest that we think of financial services as the industry in question . such services are subject to both internal and external economies of scale , which tends to concentrate them in a handful of huge financial centers around the world , one of which is , of course , the city of london . but now we face the prospect of seriously increased transaction costs between britain and the rest of europe , which creates an incentive to move those services away from the smaller economy ( britain ) and into the larger ( europe ) . britain therefore needs a weaker currency to offset this adverse impact . does this make britain poorer ? yes . it ’ s not just the efficiency effect of barriers to trade , there ’ s also a terms-of-trade effect as the real exchange rate depreciates . but it ’ s important to be aware that not everyone in britain is equally affected . pre-brexit , britain was obviously experiencing a version of the so-called dutch disease . in its traditional form , this referred to the way natural resource exports crowd out manufacturing by keeping the currency strong . in the uk case , the city ’ s financial exports play the same role . so their weakening helps british manufacturing – and , maybe , the incomes of people who live far from the city and still depend directly or indirectly on manufacturing for their incomes . it ’ s not completely incidental that these were the parts of england ( not scotland ! ) that voted for brexit . is there a policy moral here ? basically it is that a weaker pound shouldn ’ t be viewed as an additional cost from brexit , it ’ s just part of the adjustment . and it would be a big mistake to prop up the pound : old notions of an equilibrium exchange rate no longer apply .",1476215452,"ukpolitics",2,"t3_56zz3v","t3_56zz3v"

"UdXYx","&gt;This is a claim that's made a lot, I'm not really sure it's true. 

Its true.

&gt;I mean, I'm now pressing my fingers on a piece of glass on which I can instantly communicate with all my friends and family, probably even anyone my friends or family know, I can access an almost infinite amount of entertainment and I have instant access to pretty much all public domain knowledge in the history of human civilisation.

Can you afford a roof over your head or to have a family?

&gt;Almost everyone in my (I'm guessing our) generation can say the same. My generation has had a better comprehensive education than our parents or grand parents which more than likely lasted longer, we're much, much more likely to go to university and we're less likely to have to work, say, down a mine. 

Yes, you can get yourself into debt getting qualifications you don't need and there are no proper jobs.

&gt;Average income is now greater, average standard of living is greater, access to health care is greater, less likely to be a victim of crime, our towns/cities are more diverse which means we can more easily access foreign food and befriend people from different countries... I could go on. 

Average income sn't greater, the standard of living is only greater if you ignore its paid for with debts, acess to healthcare fair enough, diversity comes with downsides (rotherham, low wages, no communities etc)

&gt;So generally we aren't fucked compared to them. We are fucked in the sense that an ageing population and unfunded pensions/welfare schemes for the elderly means there'll be more pressure on our generation to pay for it - but I haven't heard anyone in public life suggest anything like a solution, certainly not Jeremy Corbyn. 

You are fucked in the sense that the basic of humanity are unaffordable. yes you can play candy crush. Would you really swap that for the ability to have children and buy a cheap house if offered a straight swap?

"UdXYx","&gt;It depends on the feeling. If someone enjoys being imposing and intimidating, and the person they're doing it to doesn't like it, you're saying that both feelings are equally justified and the first person can just carry on because their feelings are no less important?

No. I'm saying that doing something which is literally harmless is literally harmless. ""I feel bad"" isnt a reason for other people to change their behaviours.

&gt;No, I rejected it because it's unrealistic, and gave the equivalent example of me being eyeballed by an MMA fighter. If you're saying I should take the risk of escalating things in order to stop something I don't like, you have a poor understanding of psychology and risk/reward.

And I explained what happens. if the only people who can stare at other people are MMA fighters, then you haven't fixed anything. MMA fighters will carry on staring and everyone else loses the option. 

This is why redpillers talk about ""shit testing"" - if you avert your gaze you get no interactions. If you ignore the plea to avert your gaze, you creep some women out but also get your dick sucked. 

By design men have to spam approach. By design women have to reject many advances. 

By making it harder to spam approach, women are asking nice men to leave the field and only the shitheads will be left. Its then hard to claim you are looking for a nice guy etc - actions are deliberately designed to weed them out.

&gt;Women are abused, hassled, and sexually assaulted. By men. Come back to me when men get killed, beaten and raped by women as much as the other way around.

Men get killed more by men but your position completely ignores the fact that pretty much all men can treat women badly physically at all times and dont. 

&gt;The difference with the risky jobs is that men choose to do them. Unless they're in a country with zero alternative, they don't have to.

Which are also ridiculous.

&gt;Yes, you have. There aren't that many of them; it would be a huge reduction. You haven't eliminated the problem, but the more people that consider how their behaviour makes others feel, the better. 

Great, so how do men feel being told their natural sexual impulses are unwanted and immoral?

Do we want an equivalent rule saying women cannot talk about mens salaraies or achievements?

&gt;Tbh that's never really been a problem for me. When I talk to women, I look at them just about as much as I do when I talk to man. I've never pulled on a first interaction mind you, only once had a one-night stand, but I've laid the groundwork by just talking to them like I'd talk to anyone, having a normal conversation. At a later date, I might say something flirty, see if they respond, and go from then until I get my dick sucked.

Marvellous.

&gt;Not by design, but by habit. 

No, by design. Check it on down to the biological level.

&gt;They're not at all. There's nothing wrong with approaching a woman and talking to her in a non-threatening, non-creepy way. That's how a nice guy does it. A shithead goes up to every woman and essentially makes it clear that he wants to fuck which, while at least honest, isn't usually what women are up for from a total stranger. Mentally, at least. Physically, maybe. Women tend to get more 'to the point' the drunker they get.

oh, right. You are on the maddona/whore thing.

&gt;It doesn't, and I certainly don't want to make it sound like I believe all men are pricks; they aren't. But just because most men aren't thieves, doesn't mean most shops don't get stolen from. Similarly, just because most men don't grope strangers, doesn't mean most women haven't been groped by a stranger. It's an inbuilt risk to being a woman, which they are all aware of. The safer us good guys can make them feel (or let them be), the better.

So why is the solution to thievery to give the goods away? 

&gt;I shouldn't think so, no. Can't say I have the stats to hand, but I'm reasonably certain that in most countries the only jobs available aren't usually ones which involve a huge risk of death. Those ones might pay better though.

Good fucking luck with getting that sort of equality.

&gt;Starting with cells? Taking nature as your model for how humans should behave, you'd think it would be perfectly fine to fight to the death over women, indulge in rape, and for women to eat men after sex. Nature is not a good role-model for ethical behaviour.

Great, so you accept that mens job is to approach and try to fuck as many women as possible by making lots of (doomed to fail) attempts and its womens job to shut them down.

At the wider countries expense.

"UdXYx","&gt;Have you any evidence that Sweden doesn't give people who could be considered natural enemies of the state fair trials? Where the justice system hasn't acted independently?

None at all. 

Doesn't need any, frankly. Very obvious that people have their biases and those who work for the state don't like it when its being undermined. 

Do you have any evidence that sweden is special in having impartial judges when it comes to issues surrounding the state itself? Nowhere else ever has.

&gt;Having juries doesn't mean that a justice system is any more likely to be fair or to come to the right result or to upholds standards of justice and independence from the government - if anything you're likely to find that those with non-jury systems tend to think that the nature of the general public to be capricious and to base opinions on half-truths and prejudices makes them a poor judge of evidence in a criminal justice system. There's no evidence that they'd necessarily be any more reliable in controversial cases like this. Jury trials are one system, the system used in Sweden is another. And Sweden's reputation for justice is solid

Doesn't address any of my points re natural bias of people who have high level positions in the state.

&gt;Again, that's your opinion but I understand why you want to portray it as objective

No, its objective.

Different argument.

&gt;The attitude of 'things can't get any worse' that drove the protest vote demographic is built on sand. You take a young NEET from somewhere in England who failed their GCSEs and a subsistence farmer in Bangladesh and compare the two, and the only real difference you'll find between them is the economic strength of the country they were born into. Things can definitely get worse for those who are struggling - and it's looking like they probably will. I think a lot of people fail to appreciate exactly how low the floor goes.

None, but that's ok we can vote them out. Its really simple.

Why?

&gt;I see where you're coming from, but that's a ludicrous amount of money. We couldn't ever afford to spend that much, not even in nominal terms in a century. There'd be so much money that the NHS wouldn't know what to do with it - and we'd end up wasting 35% of our GDP. Let's not forget that we've chucked money at the NHS before without a plan, and nothing improved, in fact, waiting times got worse. 

Might not have been enough money :)

&gt;Just because the point of the NHS isn't to be efficient, doesn't mean it shouldn't be efficient - and the NHS is one of the most wasteful health organisations in the world. Every penny wasted on the NHS is a penny that could be used to actually improve the nation's health, or be spent in other departments (such as education, sports, government services and investment) - and all of these options are better than money being frittered down the drain because people don't want the NHS to be criticised or reformed.

After 9 times, yes, it is reasonable - this is why sexual history is important in these cases. If a woman has bought every man he has slept with a scarf just before having sex and she bought her alleged rapist a scarf just before she had sex, it indicates a frame of mind.
