"UdXYx","the much-hyped severe brexit recession does not , so far , seem to be materializing – which really shouldn ’ t be that much of a surprise , because as i warned , the actual economic case for such a recession was surprisingly weak . ( ouch ! i just pulled a muscle while patting myself on the back ! ) but we are seeing a large drop in the pound , which has steepened as it becomes likely that this will indeed be a very hard brexit . how should we think about this ? originally , stories about a pound plunge were tied to that recession prediction : domestic investment demand would collapse , leading to sustained very low interest rates , hence capital flight . but the demand collapse doesn ’ t seem to be happening . so what is the story ? for now , at least , i ’ m coming at it from the trade side – especially trade in financial services . it seems to me that one way to think about this is in terms of the “ home market effect , ” an old story in trade but one that only got formalized in 1980. here ’ s an informal version : imagine a good or service subject to large economies of scale in production , sufficient that if it ’ s consumed in two countries , you want to produce it in only one , and export to the other , even if there are costs of shipping it . where will this production be located ? other things equal , you would choose the larger market , so as to minimize total shipping costs . other things may not , of course , be equal , but this market-size effect will always be a factor , depending on how high those shipping costs are . in one of the models i laid out in that old paper , the way this worked out was not that all production left the smaller economy , but rather that the smaller economy paid lower wages and therefore made up in competitiveness what it lacked in market access . in effect , it used a weaker currency to make up for its smaller market . in britain ’ s case , i ’ d suggest that we think of financial services as the industry in question . such services are subject to both internal and external economies of scale , which tends to concentrate them in a handful of huge financial centers around the world , one of which is , of course , the city of london . but now we face the prospect of seriously increased transaction costs between britain and the rest of europe , which creates an incentive to move those services away from the smaller economy ( britain ) and into the larger ( europe ) . britain therefore needs a weaker currency to offset this adverse impact . does this make britain poorer ? yes . it ’ s not just the efficiency effect of barriers to trade , there ’ s also a terms-of-trade effect as the real exchange rate depreciates . but it ’ s important to be aware that not everyone in britain is equally affected . pre-brexit , britain was obviously experiencing a version of the so-called dutch disease . in its traditional form , this referred to the way natural resource exports crowd out manufacturing by keeping the currency strong . in the uk case , the city ’ s financial exports play the same role . so their weakening helps british manufacturing – and , maybe , the incomes of people who live far from the city and still depend directly or indirectly on manufacturing for their incomes . it ’ s not completely incidental that these were the parts of england ( not scotland ! ) that voted for brexit . is there a policy moral here ? basically it is that a weaker pound shouldn ’ t be viewed as an additional cost from brexit , it ’ s just part of the adjustment . and it would be a big mistake to prop up the pound : old notions of an equilibrium exchange rate no longer apply .",1476215452,"ukpolitics",2,"t3_56zz3v","t3_56zz3v"

"UdXYx","it sounds great but its not going to happen is my point . i think krugmans point ( and i agree with it ) is that the falling pound etc will rebalance things all by itself . manufacturing is going to rise because the city is going to start to move out and become less of a profit centre . the simple fact of the matter is we are a net importer and imports just got more expensive . the city does n't actually make real goods ( like food ) it just trades its expertise in moving money around for them .",1476539250,"ukpolitics",1,"t1_d8t1b6k","t3_57laja"

"UdXYx","no , you go to the bank and ask *how much* you can borrow and you then have to outbid other people who have also gone to a bank and asked *how much* they can borrow . the person who borrows the most money , wins the bid . that money will have been borrowed into existence by the act of them borrowing it - maning that banks set the price of housing via how much they will lend . the buyers finances only matter as far as repayment goes , but if they ca n't repay it does n't matter as long as their credit rating today says `` ok.
