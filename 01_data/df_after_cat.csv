"peHIx","We could realistically see all four party leaders fall this year:

Farron is absolutely useless and a lost cause. Surely some Lib Dem MPs want him gone and replaced with someone who can actually make a difference in terms of the Lib Dem vote share.

Cameron has already resigned and lost any sense of power. It will likely be Boris but there could be a more working class Tory like Steven Crabb. Could be interesting.

Jeremy is just hopeless. How anyone sees him as a positive for the Labour Party is beyond me. Failing to raise the Labour vote share in the polls since his election is inexcusable. Hopefully we see a coup against him and someone more stream lined and moderate elected.

Finally, I can't see Nigel Farage lasting much longer if UKIP are to remain a strong force in politics. He's too divisive and toxic and promotes the single issue connotation. I can see him being outed by the more Libertarian side of UKIP and the party reforming to challenge the Conservatives for the right. I don't know though, I can really see Boris siphoning the UKIP vote and causing them to be more of a fringe force.

It should be an interesting time.

He was an excellent ringmaster with a solid command of the Tory whips. His successor has a huge task ahead of them, and it could be a tremendous opportunity.

Given that leaving the EU potentially deals with the issue of immigration quite well, a major gripe in traditional Labour voters, it removes a stick which has been used to beat Labour.

They were fixated on Nigel Farage's poster to which nobody gives a fuck. Nobody is going to change their vote over a poster.

Many people began to identify Farage as the man who would fix their immigration concerns, only to see him labelled all sorts of things for discussing it. An attack on Farage and what he says feels like an attack on the people who agree with his stance on immigration.

I couldn't have wanted a different result more, but what is done is done.

This is going to be an absolutely bloody hilarious couple of months though as people come to the realisation that the reality of leaving is nothing like they expected.

Immigration is not going to drop dramatically (outside EU immigration - which obviously was always fully in government control didn't drop a jot and now, in a few years - or maybe sooner! EU immigration will be fully in governmental control I don't expect that to drop either)

I guarantee you now we will have to accept some concessions from the EU that 'outers' don't want or believed we'd get away with in order to trade freely.

The ""£350 million"" a week (lol) Well... Lets just wait and see on that. 

The most deprived areas of our country that recieved EU funding (I know, I know Brexit guys it was 'our' money anyway) but let's just wait and see if the government decides to put that money back into Wales, Cornwall, Midlands/North shall we. I very much doubt it. That's probably where I'd love to be wrong most.

If we don't like the way our leaders are taking the country then every 4 or 5 years we get to sack them (at least in principle).

The EU did not do that. It created a process where the top leaders were not democratically elected. Demos, the people. Those seeking to defend that practice in the EU, as well as the commission, by saying they were elected by the leaders of the country fundamentally misunderstand what democracy is.

And when you create an institution that does not take people's views into account from the start with safeguards to ensure that those views are taken into account, then you create a culture where the people are not listened to. That is a dangerous thing.

And ultimately I think that the vote against the EU is a vote by people feeling disconnected to the political process.

*Edit: explanation of what is actually going on.*

For over a decade the EU has had joint Battle Groups, made up of troops from various member states. However their admin and command structure is all a bit of a mess, as each Battle Group has its own one created with the Battle Group, and whenever the EU wants to do something is has to create a new ""Operational Headquarters"" to carry it out.

The proposal in this new report is *expected* to be that the EU will create a single, central Operational Headquarters, so all the Battle Groups can be co-ordinated and work together. Rather than having to have their own ones, created as and when needed.

So *if* having EU Battle Groups counts as the EU having an army, the EU already has one - thus isn't preparing to create one.

"8khZW","I don't think that everyone, or even most people who want to reduce the numbers of immigrants coming into the country are racist. But I do think that a lot of the Brexit vote was because of people wanting to reduce the numbers of immigrants and believing that was only possible outside the EU. I'm quite sure it would have been at least enough to swing the result, given that there was only 4% in it.

*This does not imply that I think all of those Brexit voters motivated by immigration are racist.* 

My concern about Hannan's approach that wants to keep free movement is that it will fail to satisfy those Leave supporters who voted at least partially on the basis of immigration - and I think that is a substantial number. If they feel like they voted Leave to reduce immigration and their concerns were ignored, they will feel betrayed. The issue will not go away. There will be significant anger from these people and they will be looking for parties that will implement their desired reductions in immigration. We could see UKIP reinventing themselves with a focus on reducing immigration now that they've achieved Brexit, and see a surge in their support. And the party that eventually comes to power as a result might want stricter immigration controls than we would get if we introduced moderate controls now.

Now you might be right in thinking that most of the Leave voters actually don't care about immigration numbers at all. I hope you are. I think an EEA deal with free movement is easily our best option outside the EU and I hope that's politically sustainable. But I worry that it isn't.

I also feel that the Leave supporters who are on reddit - mostly young people like yourself - are not at all representative of the entire base of support for Leave, and are voting Leave for quite different reasons. I understand that  you don't care about immigration. I'm really not convinced that's true of all the 17 million.","i do n't think that everyone , or even most people who want to reduce the numbers of immigrants coming into the country are racist . but i do think that a lot of the brexit vote was because of people wanting to reduce the numbers of immigrants and believing that was only possible outside the eu . i 'm quite sure it would have been at least enough to swing the result , given that there was only 4 % in it . *this does not imply that i think all of those brexit voters motivated by immigration are racist . * my concern about hannan 's approach that wants to keep free movement is that it will fail to satisfy those leave supporters who voted at least partially on the basis of immigration - and i think that is a substantial number . if they feel like they voted leave to reduce immigration and their concerns were ignored , they will feel betrayed . the issue will not go away . there will be significant anger from these people and they will be looking for parties that will implement their desired reductions in immigration . we could see ukip reinventing themselves with a focus on reducing immigration now that they 've achieved brexit , and see a surge in their support . and the party that eventually comes to power as a result might want stricter immigration controls than we would get if we introduced moderate controls now . now you might be right in thinking that most of the leave voters actually do n't care about immigration numbers at all . i hope you are . i think an eea deal with free movement is easily our best option outside the eu and i hope that 's politically sustainable . but i worry that it is n't . i also feel that the leave supporters who are on reddit - mostly young people like yourself - are not at all representative of the entire base of support for leave , and are voting leave for quite different reasons . i understand that you do n't care about immigration . i 'm really not convinced that 's true of all the 17 million .",1466867310,"ukpolitics",26,"t3_4pshg2","t3_4pshg2",2016-06-25 15:08:30,NA,NA

"V0RgE","I saw this elsewhere but thought it was excellent:

Were you a Remain campaigner? Are you sore about the referendum result? Check out these 10 top self-comforting strategies. 

1.) Call every white person who voted Leave a ""racist"", ignoring the fact that Europeans are also white. Make sure you ignore and marginalise ethnic minority leave voters.

2.) Claim that the (huge) turnout wasn't high enough. 72%? It should have been at least 75%! 80%? It should have been 85%! Make sure to keep moving the goalposts. 

3.) Make a stupid e-petition demanding another referendum, just like the socialists did when Labour lost last year. We need to keep having referendums until we get the ""right"" result. 

4.) Get over-excited about the economy, even if the impact has been pretty boring and mundane. Pretend that your 2:2 in English Literature makes you an expert on currency markets.

5.) Attack the very idea of Democracy, because it's only a good thing when it goes the way you want it to. Working class voters don't know what's good for them, but middle class liberals definitely do.

6.) Share memes bashing Brexit, ignoring the unwelcome and uncomfortable realisation that you are in the minority of public opinion.

7.) Boldly claim that Scotland will leave the UK, forgetting that A) they can't afford to B) the EU can't afford to take them C) 1.6m remain votes don't cancel out 2m NO votes. 

8.) Make fun of Boris Johnson while sweating slightly and really hoping he doesn't become Prime Minister. 

9.) Learn absolutely nothing from the campaign, blaming the result on everyone but yourself. Scaremongering and bullying are clearly the best tactics to use, there's no way they could possibly backfire.

10.)

My sister who got her first graduate job for a tech start-up in the financial services has already been told her job might be gone if the economy takes a down turn and investment dries up.

My brother who started a company in London 8 months ago, has already had a big deal fall through as a client is looking to cut expenditure and increase reserves. If the the economy retracts heavily his business would likely go under. He took on his first two employees last month and is unsure whether to keep them on permanently.

"NhfuA","[Heidi Alexander has resigned.](https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/746969808038694912)

Jeremy Corbyn’s office has issued a defiant message:

""There will be no resignation of a democratically elected leader with a strong mandate from the membership.""

How can he not resign when he doesn't even have a full cabinet?

EDIT: 

More than half of the Labour shadow cabinet is expected to stand down on Sunday in a major coup against Jeremy Corbyn, triggered by the result of the EU referendum and the leader’s decision to sack Hilary Benn.

The decision of Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary, to resign on Sunday morning is seen as hugely significant, because unlike Benn she was a more “loyal and pragmatic” member of the Corbyn team, a Labour source said.

“She is seen as a moderate, practical and pragmatic voice,” they said. “Hilary always had a problem with Jeremy. **Now that Heidi’s gone, most of the shadow cabinet will step down.** He can’t just replace those positions because other front bench ministers won’t step up to the roles.”

"2sw9R","There are definitely some people who regret their Leave vote. There are definitely some people who voted Remain and who are OK with Leave anyway.

The core issue is whether there is appetite for another vote. It seems all sides of the Leave factions are now admitting the ""£350m for the NHS"" line was wrong and is either ""about £100m"" or ""a mistake"" and none of it is happening. It seems that contrary to what was said before the vote, the leading contenders for Brexit negotiation as next PM are now up for access to common market incl. free movement of people and the alignment of UK law and EU law but with no say in that law (i.e. the Iceland/Norway/Swiss model but without Schengen).

In that context, it's perfectly reasonable for some Leave voters to think they've been taken advantage of. Then, watching the markets and currency moves in recent week, that'll start to cause a problem. When white van man notices his petrol is 10% more expensive and food in the shops is a bit pricier and inflation starts to bite, he too will think ""hang on, I didn't vote for this"" - hence why Leave are now _really_ pushing on the ""it'll be painful for a bit, but fine longer term"" line.

It hasn't quite sunk in yet for most people, but we have no effective government. Cameron says he is staying on until October, but he literally can't do anything now.

But those plans can't be made by a pro-remain government because they literally have no mandate - their vision clearly does not match the vision of the people who voted leave.

Should the government have planned to see Britain through until a new government takes over? Most fucking definitely. But as (I hope) the British public will now come to realise - Cameron's government was always guided by ideology and there never was a long-term plan.

Cameron's run will now be summarised by the following line [he reportedly said to his aides following his resignation speech](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-brexit-resignation-david-cameron-reportedly-asks-aides-why-should-i-do-the-hard-st-a7102431.html):

For all the bullshit going around, Britain was a strong member of the European Union and did way more than it had to, PARTICULARLY in the area of immigration. 

Your desire is to see the EU try to be confrontational with the UK but really that's NOT going to happen. I'll say one name.. Angela Merkel... just look up her reaction, urging remaining close together and rejecting knee jerk reactions! Why? Because she knows that the German economy will be hit hard by artificial barriers to continued trade and commerce with Britain and clearly, the European Union is not more important to her than that, and that's a reasonable position to take.

The negative reactions from EU leaders and eurocrats has been somewhere between bitter ungratefulness and downright fucking delusional. Martin Schulz is so concerned now about several other countries following with their own referendums that he plans to call Merkel to try to come up with a way to stop that from happening. See, he's not the problem. Mr Juncker is not the problem. Mr Tusk is not the problem... the PEOPLE and DEMOCRACY are the problem.

David Cameron made a commitment to give a vote on EU membership because the Labour party promised a vote on the EU constitution and then reneged when it was rejected by the French and Dutch and was morphed into the Lisbon Treaty. Cameron stuck to this pledge even though he wanted the UK to stay in the EU and it cost him his political career... there is actually something to applaud in there, a commitment to stay true to his word on this issue and respect a democratic vote. He will resign because of the result.... so ask yourself why Mr Juncker's position (and the positions of his entire commission) are STILL TENABLE now that that one of its largest and most powerful members has voted to LEAVE... a member whose elected leader had opposed Mr Juncker's appointment only two years ago?

The answer is simple... David Cameron has a popular mandate from a constituency and he is accountable to it, and to the population of the country he is Prime Minister of. Mr Juncker has no such popular mandate and does not feel accountable or answerable to the European people. His commission has been an utter failure and may have resided over the beginning of the break up of the EU, and yet, I don't see him offering his resignation, do you?

The EU in its current form has got to change.. at least now Francois Hollande has the balls to say it, and the Polish came out and want to change it too to restrict its influence. Don't mistake the EU for Europe... you don't have to follow or even like the EU because you are European and you love Europe.... that's like loving FIFA because you love football. 

How the EU reacts to Britain's exit may well decide whether it will still be around in any meaningful sense in a decade from now.

"vECBz","What does a ""full free trade deal"" even mean anyway?

I want to hijack your comment to get something off my chest: We're at this stage in the debate where the referendum has passed and it still feels like most people don't know how trade deals work or what the single market we just voted to leave even is. The way people are talking just makes no sense.

Unless you're a farmer the problem is not tariffs, the EU has an average tariff of 1%. It's about institutional barriers, the differences in national regulation that impede trade. Right now a businessman doesn't need to worry about whether the goods he is producing can be sold in the EU: They have the same consumer and environmental standards and you usually only need one test, one license and one patent to do business in 28 countries. That's the beauty of the single market.

In the future people producing goods for UK markets according to UK standards will find they can't export their goods to the EU not because the EU tariffs us but simply because their standards are different. Our businessman will have to create a whole new product line to manufacture goods that do meet the EU standard and even then go through an expensive legal process to have the product tested and perhaps acquire a patent, copyright or license that is in line with their laws. This is the real barrier to free trade today: the WTO estimates that institutional trading barriers between the US and EU reduce trade by 20%. So today ""trading deal"" mostly just means harmonising regulations which is  why they are so complicated and lengthy.

In this context it makes no sense to say ""Germany will give us a good deal because they need us to trade with them"" because Germany deliberately excluding us isn't the problem. And since a good trade deal has to remove institutional barriers, any ""full free trade deal"" will require us to accept EU laws and the ECJ interpretation of those laws which is exactly what leave was against to begin with.","what does a `` full free trade deal '' even mean anyway ? i want to hijack your comment to get something off my chest : we 're at this stage in the debate where the referendum has passed and it still feels like most people do n't know how trade deals work or what the single market we just voted to leave even is . the way people are talking just makes no sense . unless you 're a farmer the problem is not tariffs , the eu has an average tariff of 1 % . it 's about institutional barriers , the differences in national regulation that impede trade . right now a businessman does n't need to worry about whether the goods he is producing can be sold in the eu : they have the same consumer and environmental standards and you usually only need one test , one license and one patent to do business in 28 countries . that 's the beauty of the single market . in the future people producing goods for uk markets according to uk standards will find they ca n't export their goods to the eu not because the eu tariffs us but simply because their standards are different . our businessman will have to create a whole new product line to manufacture goods that do meet the eu standard and even then go through an expensive legal process to have the product tested and perhaps acquire a patent , copyright or license that is in line with their laws . this is the real barrier to free trade today : the wto estimates that institutional trading barriers between the us and eu reduce trade by 20 % . so today `` trading deal '' mostly just means harmonising regulations which is why they are so complicated and lengthy . in this context it makes no sense to say `` germany will give us a good deal because they need us to trade with them '' because germany deliberately excluding us is n't the problem . and since a good trade deal has to remove institutional barriers , any `` full free trade deal '' will require us to accept eu laws and the ecj interpretation of those laws which is exactly what leave was against to begin with .",1466976574,"ukpolitics",24,"t1_d4owuyk","t3_4pz0lt",2016-06-26 21:29:34,NA,NA

"1lWZx","Because it doesn't cover services in any significant way, and most importantly it doesn't include the passporting of regulated services.

Many service industries such as insurance and banking activities are regulated. At the moment, UK businesses can use their EU ""passport"" to be regulated by the UK regulator only, even though they are providing services across the EU.

Without the passport, a company has to be regulated by the domestic regulator of each country it provides services in. That means you can't provide services in European countries directly from a UK company. Rather you have to set up significant operations in the country where you wish to provide the services, to comply with the regulations of that country. You also have to move over a significant amount of capital to meet capital reserve requirements. This massively increases the business' costs of operation and puts them on a level playing field with, say, US firms (which already have a big advantage from their large domestic market).

So a loss of passporting means a lot of businesses will have to move significant amounts of their operations out of the UK and into another EU country. This not only means that jobs are lost, it also means that the revenues booked in the UK (and therefore tax paid) decrease.

Further, a lot of foreign investment is made into the UK because of this passporting right. The UK is used as the door into the EU by a lot of international companies. They set up a UK subsidiary to be regulated by the UK regulator then passport those services directly into the EU. Without passporting that investment will rapidly dry up.

So yes, we can likely get a Canadian free trade agreement. Free trade in goods is something that is relatively easily negotiated, especially as Germany wants it too. But services - 80% of our economy - is much harder. When it comes to services, it's not a matter of tariffs, it's a matter of whether you can provide the service *at all*.

Now, the reason why you are unlikely to get passporting in a bilateral deal is that in order to have passporting, you have to harmonise the regulatory regimes in each of the countries with passporting rights. If you didn't, then countries with more lax regulator regimes would have an unfair competitive advantage, and would also export the risk of their lax regulation. So to qualify for passporting, a company has to comply with a ton of EU regulations which are designed to put firms on a level playing field even when they are regulated by different countries' regulators. For financial services, those EU regulations are:

- Capital Requirements Directive (2013/36/EU);

- Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC);

- Insurance Mediation Directive (2002/92/EC);

- Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC);

- Undertaking Collective Investment Scheme Directive (85/611/EEC);

- Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC);

- Second Electronic Money Directive (2009/110/EC);

- Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (2011/61/EU).

If we want passporting we will have to continue to accept a large amount of EU regulation. And now, because we're exiting, we will no longer have a say over that law. We were able to veto a financial transaction tax when we were EU members, meaning that the countries that wanted it had to proceed on an ""enhanced cooperation"" basis instead (basically only the countries that want it are subject to it). But without us to veto it, the financial transactions tax could become EU law which the UK may have to accept if it wants access to passporting.","because it does n't cover services in any significant way , and most importantly it does n't include the passporting of regulated services . many service industries such as insurance and banking activities are regulated . at the moment , uk businesses can use their eu `` passport '' to be regulated by the uk regulator only , even though they are providing services across the eu . without the passport , a company has to be regulated by the domestic regulator of each country it provides services in . that means you ca n't provide services in european countries directly from a uk company . rather you have to set up significant operations in the country where you wish to provide the services , to comply with the regulations of that country . you also have to move over a significant amount of capital to meet capital reserve requirements . this massively increases the business ' costs of operation and puts them on a level playing field with , say , us firms ( which already have a big advantage from their large domestic market ) . so a loss of passporting means a lot of businesses will have to move significant amounts of their operations out of the uk and into another eu country . this not only means that jobs are lost , it also means that the revenues booked in the uk ( and therefore tax paid ) decrease . further , a lot of foreign investment is made into the uk because of this passporting right . the uk is used as the door into the eu by a lot of international companies . they set up a uk subsidiary to be regulated by the uk regulator then passport those services directly into the eu . without passporting that investment will rapidly dry up . so yes , we can likely get a canadian free trade agreement . free trade in goods is something that is relatively easily negotiated , especially as germany wants it too . but services - 80 % of our economy - is much harder . when it comes to services , it 's not a matter of tariffs , it 's a matter of whether you can provide the service *at all* . now , the reason why you are unlikely to get passporting in a bilateral deal is that in order to have passporting , you have to harmonise the regulatory regimes in each of the countries with passporting rights . if you did n't , then countries with more lax regulator regimes would have an unfair competitive advantage , and would also export the risk of their lax regulation . so to qualify for passporting , a company has to comply with a ton of eu regulations which are designed to put firms on a level playing field even when they are regulated by different countries ' regulators . for financial services , those eu regulations are : - capital requirements directive ( 2013/36/eu ) ; - solvency ii directive ( 2009/138/ec ) ; - insurance mediation directive ( 2002/92/ec ) ; - markets in financial instruments directive ( 2004/39/ec ) ; - undertaking collective investment scheme directive ( 85/611/eec ) ; - payment services directive ( 2007/64/ec ) ; - second electronic money directive ( 2009/110/ec ) ; - alternative investment fund managers directive ( 2011/61/eu ) . if we want passporting we will have to continue to accept a large amount of eu regulation . and now , because we 're exiting , we will no longer have a say over that law . we were able to veto a financial transaction tax when we were eu members , meaning that the countries that wanted it had to proceed on an `` enhanced cooperation '' basis instead ( basically only the countries that want it are subject to it ) . but without us to veto it , the financial transactions tax could become eu law which the uk may have to accept if it wants access to passporting .",1467012012,"ukpolitics",38,"t3_4q1ppo","t3_4q1ppo",2016-06-27 07:20:12,NA,NA

"f3dzt","The US was downgraded in 2011 because of worries surrounding the government shutdown at the time. Political brinksmanship made the ratings agencies realise that there actually is a practical non-zero risk of a US default if congress fails to raise the debt ceiling on time. The same worries cropped up in 2013. But the economy recovered quickly once the political crisis was resolved - it was a political issue, not an economic one.

The UK's case is very different. By leaving the EU, we're facing fundamentally uncertain conditions. No one has ever done this before, so there's a lot more uncertainty than the US situation. We may potentially see a lot of damage to our financial sector too, which comprises 10% of our GDP. Basically, the UK's downgrade this time is because of structural issues - it should be taken as more serious than the US one. Of course, the ratings agencies do sometimes jump the gun, but let's be careful not to dismiss this as nothing.

*Just to add: The US only holds an AA+ rating with S&amp;P, it maintains AAA equivalent with the other two main agencies. Generally, two out of three is required to make a meaningful difference to the composite rating. The UK currently holds AA (negative outlook) with S&amp;P, Aa1 (AA+ equivalent, negative outlook) with Moody's, and AA+ (stable outlook, you optimists, you) with Fitch. That means we're on watch for further downgrades, and therefore a further hit to the composite rating.

**Second edit: This one I'm less sure about, so any more informed redditors out there, please correct me if I'm wrong. But my understanding is that the pound's lows in the mid 1980s was due to overvaluation of the US dollar. In the early 1980s Fed Chairman Volcker enacted increasingly tight monetary policy to combat the 13% or so inflation in the US at the time. This meant raising interest rates to around 20% at its peak, which caused the US dollar to shoot up in value. So, GBPUSD being so low was less a factor of the UK economy and instead more external factors. That the pound has fallen in value so much this time, and is purely driven by UK-related factors, makes its impact potentially more significant than any time in recent history.

**tl;dr The UK downgrade is probably more serious than the US downgrade. This is the lowest the pound has been since the 1980s, and even then the fall was caused primarily by external factors, rather than a slowdown of the UK economy.**","the us was downgraded in 2011 because of worries surrounding the government shutdown at the time . political brinksmanship made the ratings agencies realise that there actually is a practical non-zero risk of a us default if congress fails to raise the debt ceiling on time . the same worries cropped up in 2013. but the economy recovered quickly once the political crisis was resolved - it was a political issue , not an economic one . the uk 's case is very different . by leaving the eu , we 're facing fundamentally uncertain conditions . no one has ever done this before , so there 's a lot more uncertainty than the us situation . we may potentially see a lot of damage to our financial sector too , which comprises 10 % of our gdp . basically , the uk 's downgrade this time is because of structural issues - it should be taken as more serious than the us one . of course , the ratings agencies do sometimes jump the gun , but let 's be careful not to dismiss this as nothing . *just to add : the us only holds an aa+ rating with s & p , it maintains aaa equivalent with the other two main agencies . generally , two out of three is required to make a meaningful difference to the composite rating . the uk currently holds aa ( negative outlook ) with s & p , aa1 ( aa+ equivalent , negative outlook ) with moody 's , and aa+ ( stable outlook , you optimists , you ) with fitch . that means we 're on watch for further downgrades , and therefore a further hit to the composite rating . **second edit : this one i 'm less sure about , so any more informed redditors out there , please correct me if i 'm wrong . but my understanding is that the pound 's lows in the mid 1980s was due to overvaluation of the us dollar . in the early 1980s fed chairman volcker enacted increasingly tight monetary policy to combat the 13 % or so inflation in the us at the time . this meant raising interest rates to around 20 % at its peak , which caused the us dollar to shoot up in value . so , gbpusd being so low was less a factor of the uk economy and instead more external factors . that the pound has fallen in value so much this time , and is purely driven by uk-related factors , makes its impact potentially more significant than any time in recent history . **tl ; dr the uk downgrade is probably more serious than the us downgrade . this is the lowest the pound has been since the 1980s , and even then the fall was caused primarily by external factors , rather than a slowdown of the uk economy . **",1467062544,"ukpolitics",51,"t1_d4qck7w","t3_4q4tsh",2016-06-27 21:22:24,NA,NA

"wzVkI","Unbelievable. You will not have any sympathy or compassion when an entire social class descends into further poverty and instability, but will actually enjoy it? With a bitter grin?

 It is a similar combination of generalising millions of people and self-centredness which were on the side of many who voted leave. Where that brush of xenophobia which was used so much actually does hit true.

The effects of deindustrialisation were not just handled poorly, but were part of a significant attack on the social unity of the working classes, the legacy of which was so far reaching and is certainly still visible today. It is not just about the mines. Of course the rich people won't suffer, many benefited from the recession. As a protest vote against the political elite, this is not going to really have any great outcomes unless this country can have some unity.

Personally, the vote for me is a sign of the times. Mainly just how much hatred and division there is in Britain since the failure of third way politics. Ageism is rife on both sides with a growing elderly babyboomer demographic and a youth which has finally latched on to being shafted, yet can't mobilise due to their poor deal. The division of wealth is increasing even further. Multiculturalism has been a struggle which has been effectively manipulated by the media to sell papers and garner clicks. 

On Friday those most vocal on social media on my friends list suddenly realised that they are still not the majority and there is a world that exists outside of their echo chamber, one where over half would vote to leave. 

I will tell you I did not get the result I wanted, but I have decided I am going to try my best to be part of the world and be the change I wish to see within it.

"CJ70k","&gt; If you know the difference you should stop that 'can't support independence from the UK but not the EU' nonsense. They're completely different relationships.

Why should I? Just because the relationships are different, doesn't mean the defining perimeters are. The EU is a political union. If you claim to want Independence for your country, you cannot, by the very definition of Independence, profess to enter a political union which has an extensive measure of political and legislative control over your nation.

&gt; We can be an independent country in the EU.

No you can't.

&gt; The EU will never have the same amount of power over Scotland that the UK currently has.

1; You cannot, with any degree of certainty, say that. The EU grows in strength and measure of control every year. There is no constitution or defining law preventing ever closer union and the eventual formation of a superstate. You cannot *possibly* say that the EU will not have full control over it's memberstates at some point in the future. And, if you can, can I please have tonight's Euromillion jackpot numbers, as clearly you a crystal ball? I promise to donate 50% of the winnings to the SNP (no, genuinely).

2; As I have already stated elsewhere - the *level* of control is entirely irrelevant. Just because you swap one political union for another, and the one you swapped for has measurably less control, does not mean you are independent. As long as that political entity has any level of political, legislative and judicial control over your nation, you lack national sovereignty and, as such, lack independence.

It's very, very simple.

&gt; It's like comparing living with your parents to living with some friends.

And your friends decide what the monthly household bills are spent on and where. And write up rules that you must abide, even if you don't want to but are outvoted, and decides what food you eat, which neighbours you can talk to, which parties you can attend and what you all watch on Thursday nights.

&gt; You're not fully independent in either scenario

Now you're getting it.

&gt; but you're a hell of a lot more independent when living with your friends.

But *still* not **fully** independent. Which was my original point.

"OzHL7","Doing PhD currently. Can confirm general sense of dismay. Academics now spent the majority of their time writing applications and touring the world selling their research to get citations more than they do directing their group and teaching undergraduates. The problem isn't the EU though in my opinion.

Imagine you're a dude on a funding council. You want to fund the best research. How do you do this? You need some sort of metric to compare scientists. Some choose citations - how many people cite your paper in their papers. Some people choose impact factor - the average number of citations in the journal youve published your papers in. By any metric, you're ultimately choosing how science gets funding not based on its merit or industrial relevance, but how its viewed within the community.

What is the problem with this? Well, researching doing ""blue-sky"" research get shafted over people doing research which results in steady results aka cranking the handle. A lot of researchers achieve nothing until a huge breakthrough which they then capitalise on through their career. This system promotes more incremental discoveries.

The other problem is the amount of funding going towards PhD students - I.e. bottom of the academic ladder, while little exists for those attempting to climb to the top. This, coupled with industrial research going to cheaper countries like India and china, means precious little funding exists to ensure the few academics which make it have a trained staff of post-docs to drive their research forward. It all goes into training PhDs which dont get up to speed until their third year or so.

Tl;dr - too much funding of PhDs, not enough of post-docs or lecturers, meaning the competition for advanced jobs is insane. Also, grants rely on incremental as opposed to breakthrough research.","doing phd currently . can confirm general sense of dismay . academics now spent the majority of their time writing applications and touring the world selling their research to get citations more than they do directing their group and teaching undergraduates . the problem is n't the eu though in my opinion . imagine you 're a dude on a funding council . you want to fund the best research . how do you do this ? you need some sort of metric to compare scientists . some choose citations - how many people cite your paper in their papers . some people choose impact factor - the average number of citations in the journal youve published your papers in . by any metric , you 're ultimately choosing how science gets funding not based on its merit or industrial relevance , but how its viewed within the community . what is the problem with this ? well , researching doing `` blue-sky '' research get shafted over people doing research which results in steady results aka cranking the handle . a lot of researchers achieve nothing until a huge breakthrough which they then capitalise on through their career . this system promotes more incremental discoveries . the other problem is the amount of funding going towards phd students - i.e . bottom of the academic ladder , while little exists for those attempting to climb to the top . this , coupled with industrial research going to cheaper countries like india and china , means precious little funding exists to ensure the few academics which make it have a trained staff of post-docs to drive their research forward . it all goes into training phds which dont get up to speed until their third year or so . tl ; dr - too much funding of phds , not enough of post-docs or lecturers , meaning the competition for advanced jobs is insane . also , grants rely on incremental as opposed to breakthrough research .",1467146487,"ukpolitics",27,"t1_d4rn5vd","t3_4qbeq9",2016-06-28 20:41:27,NA,NA

Clegg's biggest problem was too much foresight, that and pandering to a weak demographic. If students wanted free uni, they should have gone out and campaigned and voted. Instead his party still didn't get the support it needed, so Clegg traded off uni fees for a referendum on AV and the 10k tax band. Referendum wasn't even close but then five years later *everyone* is pissed at the election results and acts dumb about how the tories could win without a majority. 

Britain deserves the tories for falling for their bs time and time again and blaming the politicians that try to do good for not succeeding when it's the public that doesn't even come out to support them.

"Fh57v","I saw Jeremy Corbyn at my local Tesco yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.","i saw jeremy corbyn at my local tesco yesterday . i told him how cool it was to meet him in person , but i didn ’ t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything . he said , “ oh , like you ’ re doing now ? ” i was taken aback , and all i could say was “ huh ? ” but he kept cutting me off and going “ huh ? huh ? huh ? ” and closing his hand shut in front of my face . i walked away and continued with my shopping , and i heard him chuckle as i walked off . when i came to pay for my stuff up front i saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen milky ways in his hands without paying . the girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional , and was like “ sir , you need to pay for those first. ” at first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her , but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter . when she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times , he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “ to prevent any electrical infetterence , ” and then turned around and winked at me . i don ’ t even think that ’ s a word . after she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price , he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly .",1467160443,"ukpolitics",170,"t3_4qcn1h","t3_4qcn1h",2016-06-29 00:34:03,NA,NA

The exemption exists because of historic anti-semitism, not due to EU placating muslims.
