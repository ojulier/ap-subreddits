# Affective polarization in the Subreddit r/ukpolitics
Data Mining capstone project

## Milestones

### 1 Which data am I using?

This project investigates the impact of political shocks on online political discourse by analyzing Reddit comments from the ukpolitics subreddit. Specifically, the project examines user comments made during the five days preceding and the five days following the announcement of the Brexit referendum results. The primary research question guiding this analysis is: **How does a political shock influence the affective polarization present in online political discussions?** By comparing extreme positive and negative comments (with scores of 20 or higher and -10 or lower, respectively), this study seeks to uncover shifts in emotional tone and political sentiment that may signal changes in affective polarization over this critical period.

Based on data availability and the extent of the shock, the announcement of the Brexit referendum result emerged as an operationalized political shock.

### 2 Data acquisition

The data for this analysis was sourced from the politosphere dataset. Using provided scripts, comments from the ukpolitics subreddit were extracted for two distinct periods: five days before and five days after the Brexit referendum results were announced. The dataset was further refined to include only those comments that exhibited extreme sentiment, with scores of 20 or higher (positive sentiment) and -10 or lower (negative sentiment). This approach serves as an initial experimental step to gauge changes in affective polarization as a response to the political shock of the Brexit announcement.
