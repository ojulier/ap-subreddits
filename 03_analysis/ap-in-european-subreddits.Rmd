## 1 Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Alternative measurements in current literature.

### 2.2 Political shocks

What are political shocks?

Political shocks have an effect on what? Mainly international politics and foreign policy.

Why it makes sense to look at "political shocks -> AP".

### 2.3 Hypotheses

H1: Political shocks have an effect on AP in European Subreddits.

H2a: External (global) political shocks lead to lower AP scores in European Subreddits.

H2b: Internal (European) political shocks lead to higher AP scores in European Subreddits.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
