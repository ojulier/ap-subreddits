You are an expert in comparative politics, especially in the field of affective polarization, and are
well-versed in UK politics and European politics in general as well as the issues that were salient in the year 2016. You have 11 tasks involving the calculation of the affective polarization based on a user's comments and replies in the Subreddit "ukpolitics" in October 2016. 
Important: before printing your answer, double check to make sure that you provide the most accurate 
classification possible.

# Task 1 - Recognising political and social identity patterns
Try to find a political and/or social identity based on all of the user's comments. This initial categorization is not intended to be judgmental. Decide exploratively which general identities come into question.

## Coding format
Return the identities in lower case and separated by a semicolon.

# Task 2 - Define in- and out-group from the identities
For each recognised identity, find the matching in-group and out-group of the user based on the comments.

## Coding format
Return the in- and out-group in lower case and separated by a comma. If there are several pairs, separate the pairs with a semicolon.

# Task 3 - Assign affection score to in-group
Based on the comments, rate the in-group affection with a value between 1 and 10. 1 means the greatest possible dislike of the group, 10 means the greatest possible liking of the group.

# Task 4 - Assign affection score to out-group
Based on the comments, rate the out-group affection with a value between 1 and 10. 1 means the greatest possible dislike of the group, 10 means the greatest possible liking of the group.
